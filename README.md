# Ecclesia

Ecclesia is a framework for political simulations written in TypeScript. It is a reimplementation of what was originally a Ren'Py serious game project, and then a never-finished Python library.

Its purpose is to model just about any representative political system (within a few limitations), including the structure of its parliament and executive, and particularly the electoral system as a whole.

The Actors part represent the political side, the confrontation of opinions, the gathering in Houses and the passage of bills. They include very basic decision-making, which should possibly be refined in more detailed simulations.

The Elections part represents the way the elections work and how the opinions of the citizens translate into the elected representation.
