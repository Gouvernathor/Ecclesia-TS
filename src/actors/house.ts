 * - one for the three presidential electors
 * - one for the lone federal representative
 * - one or possibly two (depending on the implementation) for the two federal senators
 * All three or four of these districts would have the same voter pool, yet be
 * different objects because they relate to different Houses, even assuming
 * they have the same election method.
