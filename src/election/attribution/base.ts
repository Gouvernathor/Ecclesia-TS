 * Other errors may and will be raised by the attribution methods for other reasons,

 * If the attribution method is expected, by design, to fail under expected conditions,

 *
 * @param votes The ballots.
 * @param rest This parameter, ignored in most cases,
 * forces the attributions taking more required or optional parameters
 * to take them as an options object.
 * Attribution transforms (functions that take an attribution method and return another one)
 * should generally let that parameter pass through
 * so as to avoid breaking features in the wrapped attributions.
 * Attributions should avoid taking other parameters, for the same reason.
 *
 * @returns The attribution of seats to the parties based upon the votes.
 * It is a Counter mapping each party to the number of seats it won.
 * The return value's total() should be equal to the nSeats attributes - if any.
